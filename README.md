# code-samples-typeScript
A collection of coding exercises and solutions written in TypeScript.

All scripts are written within the src/scripts folder.

Refer to the `readme.md` file of each individually script folder to see what each script does.

## To run the script

1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Type `npm run <script_name>` where `<script_name>` is the name of the folder where the script resides

## Roadmap

1. Add `tests` for the scripts
2. Optimize scripts in `package.json`
